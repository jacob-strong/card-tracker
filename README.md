# MTG Card Tracker

MTG Card Tracker is a way to track your collection of Magic: The Gathering cards. Currently,
it just uses the name of the card in text, but I plan on integrating the Scryfall API to provide
the card image and more information.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Just go to the website

Instructions for using the software:

1. Type the name of the card
2. Press "Add to collection"
3. Use the edit/delete buttons to edit the card name or delete from collection

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* a web browser
* for development, a code editor
* It uses Firebase for the database

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Firebase Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs)
* [Firebase Tutorial for Beginners](https://youtu.be/UFD4SP91tSM?si=ezsEXXqhSR6CBISO)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ Integrate Scryfall API for card data ]
* [ Make it look nicer ]
* [ Improve upon the database to add Scryfall IDs and different quantities and printings ]
* [ User login info, right now the entire website just uses my collection lol]
